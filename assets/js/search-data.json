            "title": "Economic Distress Index",
            "content": "Methodology . The index combines seven indicators into a single, comparative measure of economic well-being. The index is constructed from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates and County Business Patterns (CBP) datasets. . The seven components of the index are: . no high school diploma—percent of the population 25 years of age and older without a high school diploma or equivalent; | housing vacancy rate—percent of habitable housing that is unoccupied, excluding properties that are for seasonal, recreational, or occasional use; | unemployment rate—the number of unemployed people as a fraction of the labor force; | poverty rate—percent of the population living under the poverty line; | median income ratio—median household income as a percent of the state’s median household income; | change in employment—percent change in the number of jobs; and | change in establishments—percent change in the number of business establishments. | . The counties are ranked on each of the seven indicators. The index is calculated by taking the average of the seven rankings, which are equally weighted, and normalizing the average to be equivalent to a percentile. Distress scores range from approaching zero to 100, such that a county with an average rank of 1,571 out of 3,142 will register a distress score of 50. . The County Maps: . You can zoom and drag the maps with your mouse just like you would on Google Maps. If you hover your mouse over a county, it will show you the county name and state, along with the following numbers: . Distress Score: These scores range from 0 to 100 and represent a percentile rank for that county. Higher scores are bad. For example, a score of 100 represents the most economically distressed county in the United States (i.e., with respect to the data I used). | Distress Rank within U.S.: This number shows how a county compares to other counties in the United States. Unlike the distress score, lower numbers are bad, so a rank of 1 means that county is more distressed, on average, than any other county in the United States. | Distress Rank within State: This only considers counties within the same state. For example, Johnson County has a rank of 105, which means it is the least distressed, on average, of the 105 counties in Kansas. | . The colors on the map are based on the Distress Score, so gold = &quot;good&quot; and blue = &quot;bad.&quot; . Notes About the Data: . The calculations present results for two time periods reflecting the composition and availability of the Census Bureau’s ACS 5-Year Estimates: 2013-2017 and 2014-2018. The 5-year estimates are constructed from five years’ worth of data collection, reflecting the length of time required to compile enough data to provide meaningful and accurate estimates at fine geographic scales, such as counties and zip codes. County Business Patterns data are available annually, and I chose to examine the years that match the ends of each ACS 5-year window. For example, the change in employment represents the percent change in the number of jobs from 2017 to 2018. . In instances where employment or establishment estimates from the County Business Patterns data were not available for a particular county, I imputed the missing values using the average for the other counties in the same state. This only affected two counties in the United States. . Economic Distress Scores for U.S. Counties . Click here to download an interactive copy of the U.S. map.

            "title": "Kansas Unemployment During COVID-19",
            "content": "Background . Many businesses are experiencing large decreases in sales and revenue as a result of state and local stay-at-home orders associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and these businesses are already responding to potential solvency and liquidity problems by laying off workers. Accordingly, the question of the day is: How high will the unemployment rate be in the second quarter of 2020? . Not all businesses, sectors, or occupations will experience the negative shock from COVID-19 equally. Many workers, such as those in professional services, may be able to work from home and continue their activities with minimal disruption. Other workers, such as those who work in occupations that involve direct physical contact with customers (e.g., restaurant waitstaff), are likely to see their jobs negatively affected by social-distancing measures and stay-at-home orders. . In this notebook, I use Kansas-specific data on occupation composition to replicate recent analysis by the St. Louis Fed, which attempts to arrive at an estimate of what the unemployment rate may look like at the end of the second quarter of 2020. The St. Louis Fed estimates a 32.1 percent unemployment rate for the second quarter of 2020. . Current Labor Statistics . I start with the state of the Kansas economy as of February 2020. According to the Kansas Department of Labor (via KLIC), the civilian labor force consisted of approxiately 1.5 million people, and the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 3.1%, which means there were around 46,000 unemployed Kansans in February. In the calculations that follow, I assumed the labor force remains constant and that none of the currently unemployed individuals would be able to find a job in the second quarter of 2020. . To estimate the Kansas unemployment rate for the second quarter of 2020, I follow recent analysis by the St. Louis Fed and combine occupation composition data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics with work context data from O*Net Online to compute how many jobs are exposed to layoff risk due to social distancing measures and stay-at-home orders. . Current labor statistics from the Kansas Department of Labor (February 2020): Civilian Labor Force = 1,496,507 Unemployment Rate = 3.1% . Methodology . In a recent article, Matthew Famiglietti, Fernando Leibovici and Ana Maria Santacreu combine individual-level data from the 2017 American Community Survey with information on occupational contact intensity from O*NET to determine how many people work in occupations that require the worker to perform tasks in close physical proximity to other people. They find that 27.3 million workers have occupations with a high contact intensity. These occupations include barbers, hairstylists, food and beverage serving workers, and flight attendants, among others. . In another article, Charles Gascon uses Occupation Employment Statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to determine which occupations face a high risk of unemployment, and he estimates that 46 percent, or approximately 67 million U.S. workers, face a high risk of being laid off. . I combine the approaches from the two articles and merge state-level occupation composition data from the Bureau of Labor Statics with information on occupational contact intensity from O*NET. I saved some time by extracting the contact intensity information from the Famiglietti, Leibovici, and Santacreu dataset as it is publicly available. . area area_title area_type naics naics_title i_group 10938 20 Kansas 2 000000 Cross-industry cross-industry 10939 20 Kansas 2 000000 Cross-industry cross-industry 10940 20 Kansas 2 000000 Cross-industry cross-industry 10941 20 Kansas 2 000000 Cross-industry cross-industry 10942 20 Kansas 2 000000 Cross-industry cross-industry own_code occ_code occ_title o_group ... 10938 1235 11-1011 Chief Executives detailed ... 10939 1235 11-1021 General and Operations Managers detailed ... 10940 1235 11-1031 Legislators detailed ... 10941 1235 11-2011 Advertising and Promotions Managers detailed ... 10942 1235 11-2021 Marketing Managers detailed ... h_median h_pct75 h_pct90 a_pct10 a_pct25 a_median a_pct75 a_pct90 10938 69.85 # # 37580 96030 145280 # # 10939 38.33 58.19 85.65 43300 57610 79720 121040 178140 10940 * * * 16150 16930 18230 19590 28430 10941 48.02 69.85 98.29 55660 66490 99880 145290 204450 10942 63.9 87.05 # 68090 94480 132910 181060 # annual hourly 10938 NaN NaN 10939 NaN NaN 10940 TRUE NaN 10941 NaN NaN 10942 NaN NaN [5 rows x 30 columns] . The Kansas Occupation Employment Statistics data contain a column named occ_code, which represents the six-digit occupation code; however, the Famiglietti, Leibovici, and Santacreu data contain a four digit occupation code (and no hyphen), so we need to create a similar field in the Kansas dataset that we can use to match the Famiglietti-Leibovici-Santacreu data. . area area_title area_type naics naics_title i_group own_code 0 20 Kansas 2 000000 Cross-industry cross-industry 1235 1 20 Kansas 2 000000 Cross-industry cross-industry 1235 2 20 Kansas 2 000000 Cross-industry cross-industry 1235 3 20 Kansas 2 000000 Cross-industry cross-industry 1235 4 20 Kansas 2 000000 Cross-industry cross-industry 1235 occ_code occ_title o_group ... a_pct75 0 11-1011 Chief Executives detailed ... # 1 11-1021 General and Operations Managers detailed ... 121040 2 11-1031 Legislators detailed ... 19590 3 11-2011 Advertising and Promotions Managers detailed ... 145290 4 11-2021 Marketing Managers detailed ... 181060 a_pct90 annual hourly soc prox_index score essential home_work 0 # NaN NaN 1110 48.66666793823242 0 0 0 1 178140 NaN NaN 1110 48.66666793823242 0 0 0 2 28430 TRUE NaN 1110 48.66666793823242 0 0 0 3 204450 NaN NaN 1120 43.400001525878906 0 0 1 4 # NaN NaN 1120 43.400001525878906 0 0 1 category 0 General and Operations Managers 1 General and Operations Managers 2 General and Operations Managers 3 Public Relations and Fundraising Managers 4 Public Relations and Fundraising Managers [5 rows x 36 columns] . Calculating the Second-Quarter Unemployment Rate . The St. Louis Fed analysis averages the numbers from the Famiglietti-Leibovici-Santacreu and Gascon articles to arrive at a point estimate of the number of workers at risk of being laid off during the second quarter. This results in approximately 47 million people being laid off during this period. This is quite high as it assumes everyone in a &quot;high risk&quot; occupation will become laid off. Therefore, I depart from the St. Louis Fed analysis by taking into account the fact that some occupations have been designated as essential and face a lower risk of layoff. Using guidance from the Kansas Essential Functions Framework, I added a field to the Famiglietti, Leibovici, and Santacreu data that indicates whether an occupation is essential. . To calculate the expected layoffs, I added the numbers for the occupations in the highest contact intensity category (following followed Famiglietti, Leibovici, and Santacreu), and I subtracted the numbers from occupations that are essential (my innovation). Adding the expected layoffs to the initial number of unemployed in February results in approximately 66,000 total unemployed Kansans. Given the assumption of a constant labor force, this results in an unemployment rate of 4.4 percent. . Steps to calculate the estimated unemployment rate (using data from Method 1): 1. Kansas civilian labor force in February 2020 = 1,496,507 (KDOL) 2. Kansas unemployment rate in February 2020 = 3.1% (KDOL) 3. Unemployed Kansans in February 2020 = 46,392 (#1 * #2) 4. Kansas workers in high contact-intensive occupations = 293,880 (Nigel&#39;s calculations using O*Net data) 5. Kansas workers employed in &#34;essential&#34; occupations = 274,370 (Nigel&#39;s calculations using KEFF guidance) 6. Estimated layoffs in second quarter 2020 = 19,510 (#4 - #5) 7. Unemployed Kansans in second quarter 2020 = 65,902 (#3 + #6) 8. Kansas unemployment rate in second quarter 2020 = 4.4% (#7 / #1) . Sensitivity Analysis . The St. Louis Fed estimate of 32.1 percent seems a bit high, but my estimate of 4.4 percent seems very low, especially given the large spike in the number unemployment insurance claims. This is because my estimate assumes everyone in an &quot;essential&quot; occupation will retain his or her job, which is probably not the case. For example, restaurants need cooks and delivery drivers, but they do not need waitstaff right now. Some waiters and waitresses may assist with deliveries, which may keep their hours from getting cut, but dishwashers will work fewer hours as they will be washing fewer dishes. We can look at the sensitivity of the estimated unemployment rate to different assumptions in the retention rate of essential occupations. That is, maybe restaurants will only retain 50 percent of their staff instead of 100 percent as the estimate currently assumes. . The graph below shows the calculated unemployment rate based on different retention rates for essential occupations. The estimated Kansas unemployment rate for Q2 2002 ranges from 4.4 percent to 22.7 percent, where 22.7 percent assumes no retention of essential occupations (similar to the St. Louis Fed analysis). . . . Summary of Calculations . It is important to note that the estimates make several important assumptions: . the calculations assume the labor force is constant and exclude the fact that some recently unemployed workers may become discouraged and cease looking for employment (i.e., no longer technically unemployed); | many businesses may send workers home with pay, rather than laying them off; | only occupations with a proximity score of 2 are at risk of being layed off; | the sensitivity analysis assumes retention rates are the same accross all occupations; and | the calculations do not account for any potential effects of fiscal measures, such as the recent stimulus package or changes in unemployment insurance policy. | . It is also important to keep in mind that these are rough calculations. As such, any attempts to place upper and lower bounds on these estimates would follow the same inexact process. The estimates are sensitive to a number of assumptions, but we may be able to relax some of these assumptions with better and more up-to-date data. . The expected duration of unemployment matters just as much, if not more, than the unemployment rate itself, especially if the recovery is quicker than we anticipate; however, the uncertainty around when and where it will be safe to resume certain economic activity makes ex ante analysis of the economic impact of COVID-19 somewhat impossible. At best, we can look at what may happen if different scenarios unfold. . Other Limitations and Areas for Improvement . Even though I followed guidance from the Kansas Essential Functions Framework, the designation of occupations as essential is somewhat subjective. It might be nice to have others weigh in on which occupations meet the conditions of these guidelines. . Also, I started working on adding a field that indicates which positions may be performed from home (we would be able to subtract these from the unemployed as well), but this is also very subjective. I thought O*NET might also have some sort of &quot;work-from-home&quot; score, but I haven&#39;t been able to find anything like that yet. .",
